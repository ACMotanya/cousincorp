        </div>
        <p>Cousin has been family-owned for over 40 years. It all began in 1970 as Enterprise Art, a retail craft store in Largo, Florida. With the success of the arts and crafts, floral and home decor products, a wholesale division was created and Cousin was born. The popularity of jewelry making inspired us to focus our efforts on products for this exciting craft. With the addition of our fashion accessory division Laura Janelle, today we are a premier wholesaler of jewelry making supplies and a full service fashion company.</p>

        <p>Whether it's findings, accents or tools from our Cousin DIY division or trendy jewelry and fashion accessories from our Laura Janelle division, our products are developed from the direct result of extensive trend research and data intelligence. From publications to paid trend resources to fashion trade shows to the runways we are constantly gathering and analyzing data from around the world to make sure we are "on trend" all the time. We feel extremely fortunate to have an amazing group of people on our creative team. Their energy and passion for fashion is contagious!</p>
